# SQL project - internet users vs. depressions
## Objective of the project

My goal was to find out if there is a visible correlation between the increase in the number of Internet users and the registered number of depression in Germany, since Internet use has increased significantly among the general population. My hypothesis was, 
that there could be a comparable increase in both time series.

## Conclusion

After the project, I conclude that there is no direct, visible correlation between the increase in the number of Internet users and the registered number of depressions in Germany. The curve for Internet use has risen sharply since 1990, but the curve for depression has not. It has remained at a constant level.

## My approach

Based on the data available to me, I chose the period 1990 to 2019 and limited my analysis to Germany. For the depression values, I additionally performed a conversion
performed. I had the depression count only as a proportion of 100,000 persons. However, for better presentability, I wanted to present the absolute values based on the German 
population. To maintain accuracy, I took into account the population change from 1990 to 2019.
